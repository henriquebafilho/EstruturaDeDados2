Input: Sorted Array S[0...n-1] 

Output: Balanced Binary Search Tree T

***

1. Initialize start as 0, end as (length of the array - 1)

2. Set mid as (start+end)/2

3. Create a tree node with mid as root (lets call it T).

4. Recursively do following steps:

      a). Calculate mid of left sub array and make it root of left sub tree of T.

      b). Calculate mid of right sub array and make it root of right sub tree of T.
